        Ensure that no new requests are routed to a replica that is marked to be freed.
        HINTS:
        1. Use self.check_replica_to_free(replica_id) to check if a replica is marked to be freed.
        2. Note that the provided RoundRobinGlobalScheduler is unaware of scale down actions and makes the assumption that replica ids range from 0 to num_replicas-1.
           However, this doesn't hold in the event of replica scale downs when some replicas get removed from the cluster.
           Therefore, make sure to use self._replicas or self._replica_schedulers to cycle through the replica ids.
